## CSE 438: Mobile Application Development ##
# Lab 4: Movie Search App #

Overview:
In this lab, you will be implementing common iOS view structures to create something that feels like a “real app”. 
Navigation bars, tab bars, and collection views are built-in ways to structure your app’s content. 
As for the content itself, you will be hitting a remote API for JSON data to parse into your application. 
This is a common structure which is used by many popular apps on the App Store.
